my_emacs_for_php
================

This is my personal emacs configs, tuned for php development.

I got the idea from a Rails developer, Spastino.  He stopped updating his files three years ago.  Realistically, a lot of the stuff that I use is installed via defaults in the package manager...so this is just a few extra things that I use.  It also includes the theme that I use, Solarized. (both light and dark versions)  I also keep some little tweaks in here that I prefer in my emacs.
